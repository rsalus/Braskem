some simple QOL tools made out of boredom

MouseMover.java is the stealth version of my anti-idle program. It opens a very small window and moves the mouse inside of it. Moving the mouse outside of the window terminates the program. MouseMoverAlt.java is the other version -- this one has a simple start/stop button to begin and end the mouse movement. It is less innocuous but you can move the mouse around outside of the window without worrying about terminating.

CSVConvert.java grabs name/email/phone number from a txt file (typically one exported from an excel sheet) and converts it into a csv. I used it to grab and convert large sets of data from an excel file and upload it into a config server.
